    				<h1>Why I took interest in programming and what I hope to achieve.</h1>
    
    				<p><img id-"Zachary-1-Edited" src="Zachary 1 Edited.png" alt=me> <img id-"Zachary-2-Edited" src="Zachary 2 Edited.png" alt=me laughing>I view learning programming the same as learning how a car works.  I might not ever work on one, but I should know how one works as it's fundamental to modern day life.  Unlike car maintenance, however, I've been greatly enjoying my experience with programming!  I love the logic puzzle, and seeing how my code forms the things I'm making.  It's very satisfying for me to witness and be apart of.  I plan on using programming primarily as a hobby, as it isn't my major, but also to understand the workings of the various devices I'll be handling in my ideal job.  I am a biotechnology major, so I work with lots of intricate lab equipment who's inner operations I'd like to know more about.  I come to programming with a passion for video games as well.  I'm not very skilled with art, but I have a creative mind.  Programming some fun projects may be a potential outlet for that, blending one of my current hobbies with a new one to help burn time and also offer me an outlet to express myself.  I'm not just a big fan of videogames, but also tabletop RPGs.  My imagination tend to trend in a fantasy direction as a result, with a love for creating mythical imagery from my thoughts and feelings.<img id-"Controller" src="controller.png" alt=Controller> <img id-"Fantasy-Skyline" src="fantasy skyline.png" alt=Fantasy Skyline></p>
